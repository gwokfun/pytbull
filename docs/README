Pytbull  is  a  flexible  python  based  IDS/IPS  Testing Framework developed by
Sebastien Damaye.  It supports any IDS/IPS (including Snort & Suricata) provided
you can grab a text-based alerts file using FTP, FTPS or SFTP.

It  is  shipped  with  about  300 tests grouped in 9 testing modules but you can
easily write your own tests,  and even your own modules. The syntax of the tests
has been simplified  in  version 2.0.  It supports  full string based  commands,
string  based  commands using environment variables  as well as the initial list
based syntax.

Pytbull supports two main architectures: a *standalone mode* (default) where the
IDS/IPS  probe  is  plugged  on  the network as a standard client and a *gateway
mode* where all packets go thru.

It  generates  a  html  based  report  enabling  an easy understanding of alerts
triggered for each test.
